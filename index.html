									<h1>Welcome to the Applied Computer Science Labs</h1>
									<p class="lead">The Applied Computer Science Labs at Clarkson University consist of
										the Clarkson Open Source Institute and the Internet Teaching Lab. These labs,
										which are part of the Computer Science department, are almost entirely
										student-run, offering the opportunity to gain experience in managing both
										facilities and projects. Both labs are located on the 3rd floor of the Science
										Center in rooms SC334 and SC336 and were renovated due to the generosity of the
										Rechler Family Foundation, the George I. Alden Trust, and a SUR grant from IBM
										which resulted in a complete renovation in the Summer of 2006.

				<h1>Want to learn more?</h1>
				<p>If you are interested in joining the labs, learning more, and/or working in the labs for course
					credit, feel free to stop by any time the lab is open to look around and talk with current students
					and faculty. You can also find more information about each lab in particular on the "The Labs" pages

			<div class="span12">
				<h1>Want to collaborate with the labs?</h1>
				<p>Are you and your team interested in collaborating with you or using lab resources in your project? We
					welcome you to reach out to our faculty advisor Jeanna Matthews (<a href="mailto:jnm@clarkson.edu">jnm@clarkson.edu</a>). 
					She will discuss your project with you and help you navigate the options for working with us. A typical process would 
					include making plans to attend one of our weekly meetings (usually Wednesday evenings) to introduce 
					yourself and describe your project. Dr. Matthews and the Lab Directors will help introduce you to lab 
					members who may be able to help you with resources that might help your project. We ask that you come 
					back periodically to report on the status of your project and when you are done give a presentation 
					about the results of your work. We are an open community and ask that those benefiting from our lab 
					resources and community also participate in sharing news of their work with lab members so that we can 
					all grow together as a community. You are also welcome and encouraged to join our community, but periodic 
					reporting works as well. </p>
